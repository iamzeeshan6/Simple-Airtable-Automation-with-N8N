This repository contains a simple yet powerful n8n automation that automatically processes new documents added to a specific Google Drive folder. Whenever a new file is created, the workflow retrieves the document content, sends it to GPT to generate a concise summary, and stores the summarized output in Airtable. This eliminates the need to manually open, read, and review every document, saving time and improving knowledge management.
